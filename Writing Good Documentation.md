## How to Write Good Documentation

Feel free to reference this for future documentation

If it is easier to write about your assignment in google doc, figma, slides, or whatever else that is totally fine, just make it accessible to me in some way.

It is the _**easiest to build your documentation as you are working through your project**_. It can be bullet points and screenshots as you go along.

1. From your notes, refine your documentation starting from your inspiration:
    - What projects did you look at?
    - What artists did you reference?
    - How did you land on a particular aesthetic?
    - When searching for references, what keyword did you use? How did you determine those words?
2. Include any sketches you made before you started coding:
    - Illustrator is helpful to get shapes correctly
    - Procreate to play with different designs
    - Any moodboards, figma, miro, google docs
    - Pen and paper
3. Write about your techical process:
    - What were things you experimented with?
    - What experiment put you on the path for your final design?
    - Take screenshots & screen recordings of any visual outputs. i find taking a recording and making short gifs of different sections is useful! i use [https://ezgif.com/](https://ezgif.com/) to convert videos to gifs.
    - What was difficult for you to understand? Include snippets of the code and how you tried to solve the problem.
    - What had surprising outputs?
4. Include resources you reached out to for help:
    - For StackOverflow, Youtube tutorials, p5 reference, p5 sketches you looked at: a link
    - For code-generating prompting tools: cite the platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and provide a link to the chat.
    - I don't require academic citations, but providing them in a bulleted, readable list is very helpful.

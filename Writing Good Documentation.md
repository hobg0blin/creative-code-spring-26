## How to Write Good Documentation

Feel free to reference this for future documentation.

If it is easier to write about your assignment in google doc, figma, slides, or whatever else that is totally fine, just make it accessible to me in some way. I've been trying to push BrightSpace but I recognize that it is kind of a huge hassle so do you what you gotta do.

It is the _**easiest to build your documentation as you are working through your project**_. It can be bullet points and screenshots as you go along. 

For all assignments:
1. Include any sketches you made before you started coding:
    - Illustrator is helpful to get shapes correctly
    - Procreate to play with different designs
    - Any moodboards, figma, miro, google docs
    - Pen and paper
2. Write about your technical process:
    - What was difficult for you to understand? Include snippets of the code and how you tried to solve the problem.
    - What had surprising outputs?
    - What were things you experimented with?
    - What experiment put you on the path for your final design?
    - If you used AI or other external resources, what did you try before that, and how did they help you?
    - Take screenshots & screen recordings of any visual outputs. I find taking a recording and making short gifs of different sections is useful! I use [https://ezgif.com/](https://ezgif.com/) to convert videos to gifs.
3. Include resources you reached out to for help:
    - For StackOverflow, Youtube tutorials, p5 reference, p5 sketches you looked at: a link
    - For code-generating prompting tools: cite the platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and provide a link to the chat.
    - I don't require academic citations, but providing them in a bulleted, readable list is very helpful.
4. If you went beyond materials covered in class, explain **specifically** what they are, where you found them and how you implemented them.
   - If you learned them in another class or a tutorial, you can just mention it (e.g.: "I used a `map()` function that I learned about in my CS 200 course" or "I used the bounding code that I found in the Coding Train's Bouncing Ball video").
   - If you used AI, explain which code you got from it, what it does, and what you tried *before* reaching for it, preferably with code snippets - it's always best to try to do it yourself first!
   
I strongly encourage you to learn new things on your own time, but if you do so without explaining your process I will assume that you didn't actually write your own code. You are allowed to use AI if you get stuck - just explain *when*, *why*, and *how* you used it, and do your best to learn something in the process. I know this is annoying, blame Sam Altman.


5. From your notes, refine your documentation starting from your inspiration:
    - What projects did you look at?
    - What artists did you reference?
    - How did you land on a particular aesthetic?
    - When searching for references, what keyword did you use? How did you determine those words?

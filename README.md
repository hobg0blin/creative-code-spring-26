# MEDP 23400: Creative Code
Brent Bailey  
Spring 2026, Thursdays 5:30 - 8:15PM<br>
Online<br>
Office hours: Wednesday 7-8pm, on Zoom

---
### Overview

Creative Code aims to fuse computer programming and creativity to produce media that explores the affordances of digital-native work: feedback, randomness, hypertext, interactivity, and more. In this course, students learn to create digital sketches, poetry, and artwork. Through a series of targeted, incremental exercises students learn to use loops, conditional statements and logical operators to produce work of surprising complexity. To provide a theoretical framework for creative exploration we will examine the work of practicing artists and technologists who use systems in their process to develop a vocabulary for looking critically at these practices across disciplines.  

---
### Expected Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the term, students will:
- Understand p5.js and JavaScript and develop creative projects in the p5 framework.
- Understand and implement programming techniques that include conditional statements, for loops, object construction, arrays, and events.   
- Write pseudocode to sequentially think through project development.
- Develop a familiarity with applications of creative code across a variety of topics and disciplines: generative art & writing, data visualization, interactive installations, sound art, and more.
- Develop a critical and theoretical framework for analyzing emerging media artworks.

## Class Format & Expectations

### Class Format

This class covers both technical and theoretical materials.  

In practical sections, we will cover:

* JavaScript syntax and techniques with the p5.js library
* Applications of JavaScript, p5, and other forms of creative code across a variety of fields

In theoretical sections, we will cover:
* Short readings from a variety of artists, programmers, and educators.
* Artwork that incorporates programming and algorithmic thinking. 
* Feedback and critique of each other's work. 

Outside of class, you are expected to:

* Do the reading
* Practice the code and syntax
* Apply creative and practical topics in your own projects

A typical week will look like:

1. Group presentation
2. Homework/reading discussion
3. Short lecture
4. Introduce new technical materials
5. Practice new material in groups

### Expectations

1. Be curious
    * What questions are you asking?
    * What do you not know?
    * How can you find those answers?
2. Practice
    * Learning to code takes time!
    * You *will* have to do work outside of class to understand what is going on in the context of your own projects  
3. Low Stress **NOT** Low Effort
    * Process over results. Try again, fail again, fail better.
    * Whether you struggled badly, learned something, or succeeded beyond your wildest expectations, you should always write up your process in your documentation. 
    * If you made a solid attempt, engaged with course materials, and wrote documentation, you get full credit, even if it didn't work!
### Required Materials

Please bookmark these links:

1. sign up for a free account on the [p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
2. [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

As the class is on zoom, it is suggested to have access to a second monitor to be able to follow along more easily with the class demos.

**Recommended Materials** 

I highly encourage searching for extra resources online, as long as you cite your sources in your documentation. Some places I encourage you to look at:

1. [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/): a free online book written by Dan Shiffman exploring different physics applications in p5.js
2. [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/): A free resource to learn p5.js, created by Dan Shiffman. I will link these videos weekly so you can get a refresher on the materials.

### Grading
1. Midterm: 10%
2. Final: 20%
3. Homework: 25% 
4. Group Presentation: 5%
5. Participation: 30%

I expect different levels of programming experience in this course, and projects will be graded on *effort* and *thoughtfulness*, not results. "Creative" is just as important as "code". Engaging with the readings, discussion topics, and themes of the class in your assignments is more important than writing perfect code. Embrace failure - even if your code doesn't run, you will do well in this class as long as you document what you tried, what you learned, and what you're struggling with.


Each of the projects listed above will have their own detailed description available on Brightspace that includes due dates for your proposal, draft and final version.
Each homework is due by midnight of the day listed in the schedule, typically the day before our class (Wednesday). The homework assignments and reading excerpts are on Brightspace.  

#### Attendance & Participation

Your participation grade will be according to the following rubric.

| Grade | Requirements                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A     | <ul><li>show up to class on time, keep camera on, and regularly participate<li>regular communication<li>submit work on time<ul> |
| B     | <ul><li>miss less than 4 classes<li>occasional communication<li>few late assignments<ul>                                        |
| C / D | <ul><li>miss more than 4 classes<li>little communication<li>late/missing assignments<ul>                                        |
| F     | <ul><li>miss more than 6 classes<li>no communication<li>missing assignments<ul>                                                 |

Not turning your camera on or arriving to class late will be considered an absence.

If you are unable to participate in class for reasons out of your control, please let me know in advance. 

Participation can take many forms: asking questions, going to office hours, sending and reading emails, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, following instructions, active listening, etc. If you are actively engaging in class you will receive full participation credit.

#### Resubmission Policy

You can resubmit any on-time submitted exercises (read: not the final or the midterm) based on feedback for full credit as long as you notify me in two ways:

- Send an email with the name of the updated submission
- Write that you updated the assignment in the assignment comments. 

You can resubmit up until the Monday after our final class. This is to ensure you are getting feedback and learning from your mistakes.


#### Late Assignments
Any work is considered late if it is submitted after the due date posted on Brightspace. For every day the work is late, the student will receive a 10% penalty, up to a penalty of 50% of the assignment grade. You are not allowed to resubmit late work for an updated grade.

Extensions *may* be granted upon request. If you request an extension 24 hours or more before the due date and I confirm it, your grade will not be affected. Extensions will be given by discretion and may not be possible for certain assignments.

### Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is a guiding principle of the Hunter College learning community because all students should have the opportunity to learn and perform on a level playing field. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, obtaining an unfair advantage, and falsifying records or documents, whether intentional or not.
 
Hunter College upholds the right to promote academic integrity on its campus as an educational institution of the City University of New York. The College has the responsibility to review all charges of academic dishonesty and implement sanctions, including, but not limited to, failing the course, official transcript notation, suspension or expulsion from the College when it has been determined that academic dishonesty did occur. Please click [here](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/repository/files/Sanctions%20Defined.docx) to see a full list of disciplinary sanctions.

#### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools: 

For the first half of this course I would highly encourage you to to _avoid_ using AI entirely. We will cover effective use cases later in the semester, but you will find you can go much further executing your ideas when you have a solid understanding of core programming techniques.   
  
With this in mind:
* You MAY use AI in the initial stages of research, idea generation, and drafting.
* You MAY use AI for language translation.
* However, you MAY NOT not rely on AI output for significant portions of your final project form unless it is a necessary part of your project concept.
* If you use AI at any stage in the creation of your project (including initial stages, idea generation, drafting, language translation, and final form), you must properly cite and disclose this use. This should include details on the specific tool and version used, as well as the nature of your usage (for example, in code, images, and/or text/writing).
* Citation should reference both the platform and any creator (“style of”) names or references.
* If you fail to disclose the use of AI, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.

The same applies to websites like StackOverflow or other pre-existing sources of code: while copy-and-pasting is a natural part of any programmer's workflow, you are expected to give credit (cite the platform and include a link to the code used) when you use someone else's code and not to rely on unmodified code written by anyone other than you for a significant portion of your projects. 


### Accessibility 
In compliance with the American Disability Act of 1990 (ADA) and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Hunter College is committed to ensuring educational parity and accommodations for all students with documented disabilities and/or medical conditions. It is recommended that all students with documented disabilities (Emotional, Medical, Physical, and/or Learning) consult the Office of Accessibility located in Room E1124 to secure necessary academic accommodations. For further information and assistance, please call (212) 772-4857/TTY (212) 650-3230. If you have registered with the Office of Accessibility, please let me know at the start of the term.


### Hunter College Policy on Sexual Misconduct
In compliance with the CUNY Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Hunter College reaffirms the prohibition of any sexual misconduct, which includes sexual violence, sexual harassment, and gender-based harassment, retaliation against students, employees, or visitors, as well as certain intimate relationships. Students who have experienced any form of sexual violence on or off campus (including CUNY-sponsored trips and events) are entitled to the rights outlined in the Bill of Rights for Hunter College. Sexual Violence: Students are strongly encouraged to immediately report the incident by calling 911, contacting NYPD Special Victims Division Hotline (646-610-7272) or their local police precinct or contacting the College's Public Safety Office (212-772-4444). All Other Forms of Sexual Misconduct: Students are also encouraged to contact the College's Title IX Campus Coordinator, Dean John Rose (jtrose@hunter.cuny.edu or 212-650-3262) or Colleen Barry (colleen.barry@hunter.cuny.edu or 212-772-4534) and seek complimentary services through the Counseling and Wellness Services Office, Hunter East 1123.

#### Class Participation

By enrolling in this course and entering the classroom, each student makes the tacit commitment to participate in the class. Active class participation involves more than mere physical presence. Students are expected to be actively involved in the class. They should take the initiative in discussion and projects, ask relevant questions, and contribute to the overall learning environment of the class.
 
It is your responsibility:
1. To prepare for class by having read assignments, written papers and/or prepared projects 
2. To actively participate in class discussion and activities;
3. To take notes on discussions, presentations, and activities conducted within the class; 
4. To complete all course assignments, even if you are absent from a class meeting.   


 
#### Rockowitz Writing Center:

The Rockowitz Writing Center offers students help with their writing at every stage of the writing process. You can make an appointment for a live video session at: hunter.mywconline.com.


#### Counseling and Wellness Services:

Counseling and Wellness Services (CWS) is another campus resource and service center for all matriculated students that is operating remotely for counseling services at no cost to all Hunter students. You can make an appointment at: http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentservices/counseling-and-wellness.
